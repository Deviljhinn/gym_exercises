            <em>A generation ago</em>, the psychologist <a 
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_W._Bijou">Sidney Bijou</a> spent two years 
                under pioneering behaviorist B. F. Skinner. While other child psychologists had focused 
                on the use of techniques such as play therapy to identify the motives and causes of 
                problematic behavior, Bijou used Skinner's behavioral techniques to encourage positive 
                behaviors through such rewards as praise, hugs and pieces of candy. Children who were 
                defiant would be given a time-out and separated from a group activity, with the 
                expectation that the bad behavior would be its own punishment, and that any additional 
                sanctions would not have a positive effect. A child isolated from a group would strive 
                to behave appropriately in order to have the opportunity to rejoin the group.

        <h3>BRAIN IS ALSO A STORY ABOUT US</h3>
        <p>
            The brain is known to be one of most intricate organs in the human body. 
            It creates our every thought, action, memory, feeling and experience of the world 
            around us. So how can such a complex creation exist without a Creator? Learning about 
            the human body and the complexity of the world, helps strengthen our belief in Allah. 
            Without Him(SWT), such complex creations would not exist.

            <br><br>Quran 2:117 <strong>“He is the One Who has originated the heavens and the earth, 
            and when He wills to (originate) a thing, He only says to it: Be, and it becomes.</strong>
